# Chankit

**Chankit** (Channel Kit) is a lightweight, idiomatic Go library for composing transformations on channels.
It works directly with channels, making it easy to add buffering, rate limiting, filtering, and more - without setting up complex stream processors.

## Goals

- Idiomatic Go API with full `context` support
- Minimalist: minimal streaming scaffolding, just plain channels
- Composable: apply one or many stages in isolation
- Zero dependencies
- Thoroughly tested (including fuzzing)

Work in progress
